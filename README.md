1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Functions = Functions are used to perform a task or to calculate values.
	* Parameters = Parameters are passed to functions so we can interpolate them inside of the function block and later call them.
	* Arguments = We use arguments when invoking(calling) a function by passing our desired data type as it corresponds to the order of which we set our parameters to our function.
	* `if` statements = Are used to evaluate whether a certain condition is true or false.

2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.

4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.

5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.

6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
